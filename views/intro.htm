<h2>Making advanced applications, easy</h2>

<p>abaaso is an enterprise class, light weight, RESTful JavaScript framework that provides a set of classes and object prototyping to ease the creation and maintenance of pure JavaScript applications. abaaso is a Level Three framework, on the Richardson Maturity Model. Don't know REST? No problem! It's not going to get in your way.</p>
<p>abaaso extends the prototypes of Array, Element, Number, and String with methods (functions) to make magic possible. Semantic classes &amp; methods (Object Oriented Programming) strive to make anything as easy as saying it! Wait, isn't extending prototypes dangerous? No, it's the nature of the language.</p>
<p>abaaso is event oriented, with a global observer. The methods on(), fire() and un() is how you register, trigger &amp; unregister listeners. You can see what listeners are registered on something with listeners(), which accepts an optional event parameter.</p>

<h2>What's with the name?</h2>
<p>It's pronouced "a-base", and it's Ojibwe word that translates to "warming in the sun". I hope using abaaso leaves you with a similar feeling; content &amp; happy.</p>
